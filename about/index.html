<p>I’m Sergio Basurco, a software developer based in Barcelona.</p>

<p>I’m currently creating next-gen experiences for video surveillance. I was previously working with touchless interfaces for neural networks (actual brains) visualization. I’m interested in all there is. Fond of C++ and recently in a relationship with python.</p>

<p>Future goals are videogame development, deeper understanding of storytelling and experiences from any media. For long I’ve devoured comic books, games and movies. Now, I’m trying to digest them.</p>

<p>This is my portfolio and creative getaway.</p>
